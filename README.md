Parser for .MID files, parses just about anything and can dump tracks to .txt files

This little library is used for creating a hierarchy of midi messages, we use this in our demotool devise2.
As far as I know it parses just about anything.

Since it's been years since I did any actual development...
If I recall correctly there 3 midi file types, 0 1 and 2.
One of them was super rare so I never found one for testing. All the rest was able to parse, including SysEx events (obviously the data is ignored)
